# MS DOS template for HamsterCMS

To use a template, create an **DOS** folder in the **templates** folder, copy all the files there, open the admin panel on the hosting, select the page, and specify this template in the options.

![this is what theme looks like](https://github.com/turboblack/HamsterCMS_author-s_DOS_template/blob/main/dos_screenshot.png)


I invite you to visit the hosting that runs on this CMS

http://w10.host

works with both old and new technologies, and backward compatible

Enjoy your use.
